# torch-transformer-hinglish2hindi-translator
torch-transformer-hinglish2hindi-translator is a character-level translater implemented in PyTorch, specifically designed for translating Hinglish (romanized hindi) to Hindi. The translator employs a Transformer-based architecture, leveraging the power of attention mechanisms for accurate and context-aware translation.

## Key Features:
- Character-level translation for Hinglish to Hindi.
- Transformer-based architecture for improved context understanding.
- PyTorch implementation for ease of use and extensibility.
- Trained on a dataset containing Hinglish sentences and their corresponding Hindi translations.
- Suitable for small to medium-sized translation tasks.

## How to Use:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/torch-transformer-hinglish2hindi-translator.git
   cd torch-transformer-hinglish2hindi-translator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Pre-trained Model:**
   - Download the pre-trained transformer model weights.
   - Save the weights in the `models/` directory.

4. **Run the Translator:**
   - Use the provided script or integrate the translator into your Python code.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from translator import Hinglish2HindiTranslator

     translator = Hinglish2HindiTranslator(model_path='models/your_pretrained_model.pth')
     translation = translator.translate("Your Hinglish text goes here.")
     print(f"Translation: {translation}")
     ```

5. **Fine-tuning (Optional):**
   - Fine-tune the model on your specific dataset by modifying the training script and providing your dataset.
